Usage and Workflow
==================

RAFT is a frequency-domain dynamics model that can be used to compute the 
static properties and dynamic response of a floating wind system. While it 
does not have any design adjustment or optimization functionalities, it is
easy to interface with so that it can be used in the design loop of design
and optimization tools, such as WEIS. Because of its ease of use and rapid
computation time, RAFT can help design tools rapidly optimize design variables.

RAFT is run through Python, and this can be done using direction function calls 
or by using RAFT as part of the larger WEIS toolset. Guidance about using
RAFT as part of WEIS will be provided in the `WEIS documentation <https://weis.readthedocs.io>`_.

For using RAFT in a standalone capacity, the easiest way to set up a simulation is
by using a YAML input file. RAFT has a defined input file format that describes 
simulation settings, environmental conditions, and all the necessary properties
of the floating wind turbine design. This input file is discussed later on this page.

From the input file, a RAFT Model object can be generated and then interrogated to
perform the RAFT analyses and extract results. The following sections discuss the
process of running RAFT, the YAML input format used by RAFT, and the outputs 
produced by RAFT.


Running RAFT
------------

This section discusses the relevant function calls for running RAFT independently
to analyze the response of a given design across a given set of load cases. 
Calling these functions is also demonstrated in the example script provided on the
Getting Started page.


Model Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

A RAFT model is setup by creating a Model object based on input data contained in a Python dictionary. 
The dictionary can be built based off the YAML input file format described in the next section, as follows:
.. code-block::    
    
    with open('VolturnUS-S_example.yaml') as file:
        design = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)  # Load the input design yaml

    model = raft.Model(design)                            # Create the RAFT model

After the Model object has been made, RAFT can compute the corresponding 6-by-6 matrices 
for the frequency domain equations of motion (see Theory section). Then the model
can be analyzed in a number of ways, the most general of which are discussed next.
next.


Unloaded Condition Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model can be analyzed in its equilibrium unloaded position using the analyzeUnloaded method: 
.. code-block::    

    model.analyzeUnloaded()   # Evaluate system properties and unloaded equilibrium position

This will calculate all the system's static properties--including weight, mass, 
hydrostatics, and linearized mooring force and stiffness--about the system's
equilibrium position, which is also solved for in this process. It sets the
RAFT Model's states to the unloaded equilibrium position and saves these positions.


Modes and Natural Frequencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RAFT can also perform an eigen analysis of the system to compute the rigid-body natural frequencies 
and mode shapes using the solveEigen method. This computation includes mooring stiffness and added mass effects.

.. code-block::    

    model.solveEigen()   # Evaluate system natural frequencies and mode shapes



Dynamic Load Case Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system response in all specified load cases can be analyzed using the analyzeCases method. 
This will run a sequence of analysis steps for each load case, first calculating any applicable
mean wind load, then calculating the system mean offset, then calculating the system matrices
about that mean offset, and finally solving the system dynamics in the frequency domain about
that operating point. 

.. code-block::

	model.analyzeCases(display=1)  # Evaluate system response for each load case (and display metrics)

This method calls a number of lower-level methods in RAFT in the necessary sequence to properly
evaluate each case. It

- All the system static quantities are (re)evaluated

- The model is analyzed for each design load cases as follows:

  - Linear aerodynamic and hydrodynamic properties are computed for the wind and wave conditions

  - The mean system offset is calculated

  - The mooring system is linearized about the mean offset

  - The aerodynamics are recomputed considering the mean pitch angle
  
  - The nonlinear properties are linearized and the full system response is calculated using an iterative process


Finally, the pertinent results are saved in a "results" dictionary that can be 
used for further plotting and analysis purposes (using built-in FAST functions or otherwise).


Summary
^^^^^^^

The methods described above invoke a number of lower-level methods to function, and any of these methods
can be called as needed by the user in the order that suits the application. However, most applications
will follow the general sequence of setup, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, which is shown in
this documentation. The figure below shows this typical analysis sequence and the internal steps that 
are completed by RAFT to give this functionality.

Inputs
------

The input design YAML can be broken up into multiple parts. The following contains the various sections of an example
input file for the IEA 15MW turbine with the VolturnUS-S steel semi-submersible platform.

Modeling Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    settings:                   # global Settings
        min_freq     :  0.005   #  [Hz]       lowest frequency to consider, also the frequency bin width 
        max_freq     :  0.40    #  [Hz]       highest frequency to consider
        XiStart      :   0      # sets initial amplitude of each DOF for all frequencies
        nIter        :  10      # sets how many iterations to perform in Model.solveDynamics()

Site Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    site:
        water_depth : 200        # [m]      uniform water depth
        rho_water   : 1025.0     # [kg/m^3] water density
        rho_air     : 1.225      # [kg/m^3] air density
        mu_air      : 1.81e-05   #          air dynamic viscosity
        shearExp    : 0.12       #          shear exponent

Load Cases
^^^^^^^^^^

This section lists the environmental and operating conditions of each load case to be analyzed.

.. code-block:: python

    cases:
        keys : [wind_speed, wind_heading, turbulence, turbine_status, turbine_heading, wave_spectrum, wave_period, wave_height, wave_heading, current_speed, current_heading, current_turbulence  ]
        data :  #   m/s        deg    % or e.g. IIB_NTM    string            deg         string          (s)          (m)          (deg)         (m/s)           (deg)         % or e.g. IIB_NTM     
            -  [     0,         0,            0,         operating,           0,        JONSWAP,         12,          1,           0,            1,              0,                   0           ]
      
The reference height of current_speed depends on whether it is a MHK or floating wind application.
If the first (or only) rotor is underwater, then the current speed refers to the hub height of the first rotor.
Otherwise, the current speed is taken to be at the water surface.

Nonzero turbine headings are not yet supported but will be in the future.

Outputs
-------

RAFT saves all its output data in a "results" dictionary that is a member
of the Model class. These results data can be accessed directly in Python
or can be seen using built-in RAFT functionality. The outputs from RAFT 
fall into two categories: general and load-case-specific. 

General System Quantities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General system quantities include the system's mass and moments of inertia, 
hydrostatic stiffnesses, natural frequencies,
and unloaded equilibrium position. These are useful for rapid design checks
or even use as a preprocessing step to feed system quantities to other models.

The figure below is generated by RAFT and shows the calcualted system 
equilibrium state in unloaded and loaded conditions (produced using the Model.plot method).

.. image:: /images/positions.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50 %

The table below shows an example of the natural frequencies and mode shapes
calculated by RAFT. These are ordered as surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch,
and yaw. The vectors below each natural frequency indicate the mode, which
may include coupling between degrees of freedom (DOF).

Mode        1         2         3         4         5         6

Load-Case-Specific Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The load-case-specific outputs consist of motion and load response amplitude
spectra, and statistics of these responses from which mean and extreme values
can be estimated. Additional calculation of fatigue loads is planned for future work.

When interfacing with RAFT, the case results can be found in 'case_metrics'
in the Model.results data structure. Case metrics is a dictionary containing
sub-dictionaries for each turbine, identified by the numbers 0 to N-1 (where
N is the number of turbines). In the case of an array-level mooring system,
the mooring system results will be stored at the top level. Otherwise, they
will be stored individually. A partial view of the case metrics data 
structure is shown below. Typically, each of these entries will be an array
of data, with entries corresponding to the different environmental cases.

.. code-block:: yaml
    case_metrics:
        0:  # turbine 1 results
            surge_avg  # FOWT's global response results
            surge_std
            surge_max
            surge_PSD
            sway_avg
            ...
            AxRNA_avg  # FOWT's turbine results
            AxRNA_std
            ...
            Tmoor_avg  # FOWT's mooring results
            Tmoor_std
            ...
        1:  # turbine 2 results
            ...
        array_mooring:  # array-level mooring results
            Tmoor_avg
            Tmoor_std
            Tmoor_max
            Tmoor_DEL
            Tmoor_PSD

The plots below show the power spectral densities of select responses calculated from
several load cases (produced using the Model.plotResponse method).
